This sample app demonstrates the integration of various popular Android tools and features a combination of technologies such as Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Flow, and Hilt. Employing the MVVM repository pattern, the app fetches data from a sample GitHub JSON and generates a list of movies using Jetpack Compose.

## Description

This sample application exhibits the use of the following libraries and features:

- [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose): Declarative UI framework
- [Material design](https://material.io/design)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/): 100% coverage
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow): Asynchronous operations
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android): Dependency injection
- Jetpack components:
    - [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/): For navigation between composables
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): Storage, exposure, and management of UI state
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): Networking
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil): Image loading
- Navigation graphs using [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) to define screen navigation
- MVVM for the presentation layer
- [Android Architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) ([ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation))
- [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx): Jetpack Kotlin extensions

This project serves as a comprehensive example of implementing modern Android app architecture leveraging the power of Jetpack Compose and associated libraries.
